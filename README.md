This code tells you whenever you type a letter, the computer chooses randomly (when a secret key/letter is pressed). Remember, there are 26 letters in an alphabet, and the computer has to guess which letter to press. Your only goal (as a user) is to randomly type any key the computer chose. If you've found a secret key/letter, the computer will then choose a random secret key/letter (and it will message you that you have pressed a secret key). Now this may be hard to find, but you can't trick the computer so easily without pressing any key of your choice.
